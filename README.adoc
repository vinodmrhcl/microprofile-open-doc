= Eclipse MicroProfile Open Doc ( Open API +  JavaDoc + ... ) 

This MicroProfile specification aims at providing a implementation for the link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md[OpenAPI v3 specification] using JavaDoc's Doclet API that all application developers can use to expose their API documentation.

On top, it also aims to compliment MicroProfile documentation for component which are not covered under OpenAPI (only REST ) such as messaging and streams.

Further it can enhanced to cover other cloud native component such as lamda function as well.
